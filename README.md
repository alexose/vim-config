# My vim configuration

It's nothing special, really.  But it does have some useful things: 

+ Syntax highlighting using Syntastic
+ CtrlP
+ DetectIndent
+ Random helper functions scattered throughout the .vimrc

To install:
git clone git@github.com:alexose/vim-config.git
mv vim-config .vim
ln -s .vim/.vimrc
